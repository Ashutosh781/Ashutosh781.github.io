I am currently pursuing my MS in Robotics at the [Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems Institute (CoRIS)](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/CoRIS) at Oregon State University. I completed my BE in Electronics and Communication from [BITS Pilani, Goa campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in 2023.

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked at [Biorobotics lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/biorobotics/), CMU, USA under [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/). Some of my notable work there included developing a surface reconstruction module for a robotic ultrasound system and working on distributed and decentralized control for a modular leg-wheel hybrid robot.

Prior to that, I remotly collaborated with the [Pipebots](https://pipebots.ac.uk/) team at the University of Sheffield, UK under [Dr. Robert Worley](https://pipebots.ac.uk/people/rob-worley/). I mainly worked on developing and modelling acoustics simulation package to solve for higher order sound reflections in pipes.

Further details of my work can be found in the [Research](/research/) section and my papers in the [Publications](/publications/) section.

## Research Interests

My current research interests lie in developing controls and motion planning for highly dynamic systems. Apart from this, I am eager to investigate and discover applications of crucial fields such as perception and deep learning to augment traditional control approaches.
My past projects have included works on mathematical modelling, controls for legged robots, 3D vision and signal processing.

## Other Interests

 I'm all about sketching, painting, and sipping on the best coffee I can find. I've got a soft spot for uncovering quirky coffee shops snd I also like to try out new coffee brewing methods and experiment with different beans. I am also total avgeek, obsessed with all things airplane.
