I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Robotics with a minor in Artificial intelligence (AI) at the [Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems Institute (CoRIS)](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/CoRIS) at Oregon State University (OSU). I completed my BE in Electronics and Communication from [BITS Pilani, Goa campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in 2023. I have hands-on expertise in reinforcement learning, sim-to-real transfer, multi-agent systems, and whole-body control for quadrupeds and humanoids.

My current research focuses on Learning-based control for complex-legged systems such as Bipeds, Humanoids, and Quadrupeds. One of my notable project is developing a control policy for multiple Bipedal (Cassie) robots for payload transport. I am working with [Prof. Alan Fern](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alan-fern) in the Dynamic Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Lab ([DRAIL](https://mime.engineering.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/)).

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked at [Biorobotics lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/biorobotics/), CMU with [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/). My notable work there included developing a 3D surface reconstruction module for a robotic ultrasound system and working on modular snake robot locomotion.

Prior to that, I remotely collaborated with the [Pipebots](https://pipebots.ac.uk/) team at the University of Sheffield, UK, with [Dr. Robert Worley](https://pipebots.ac.uk/people/rob-worley/). I mainly worked on developing and modelling acoustics simulation packages to solve for higher-order sound reflections in pipes.

Further details of my work can be found in the [Research](/research/) section and my papers in the [Publications](/publications/) section.

## Research Interests

My current research interests lie in developing controls and motion planning for highly dynamic systems. Apart from this, I am eager to investigate and discover applications of crucial fields such as perception and reinforcement learning to augment traditional control approaches. My past projects have included works on mathematical modelling, controls for legged robots, 3D vision and signal processing.

## Other Interests

I am all about sketching, painting, and sipping on the best coffee I can find. I have a soft spot for uncovering quirky coffee shops, and I also like to try out new coffee brewing methods and experiment with different beans. I am also a total av-geek, obsessed with all things airplanes.
