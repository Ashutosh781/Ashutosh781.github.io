excerpt: 'Decentralized control of a modular leg-wheel hybrid robot'
---

Worked on developing a decentralized and distributed control policy for a modular hybrid leg and wheel six-limbed robot, each limb is comprised of identical modules.

Each module of the robot is self-contained with sensing, compute and motor driver. So working on enabling the module firmware to locally compute control commands based on local feedback and body topology.
