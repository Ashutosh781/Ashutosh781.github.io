excerpt: 'Development and control of a symmetric hexapod robot'
---

Built a working prototype of 18 DOF Hexapod to test out various basic gaits and behaviors such as twisting, alternating tripod, etc.

Designed and implemented various periodic gaits and simple optimization-based controllers for a hexapod in simulation.

Created a Simscape Multibody model of Quadruped in MATLAB for comparing four and six legged robots.

Research Rigid Body Dynamic modeling of robots, stability criterion for legged robots along with trajectory and gait optimization methods.
