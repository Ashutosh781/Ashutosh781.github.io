excerpt: '3D surface reconstruction pipeline for automated robotic ultrasound system'
---

Developed a novel 3D surface reconstruction pipeline which feeds into automated ultrasound scanning trajectory generation and comprehensive evaluation score for quantifying the quality of reconstructed point clouds.

Created an evolutionary algorithm-based real-time optimization module that determines the best trajectory for the RGB-D sensor for surface reconstruction.
