excerpt: 'Compound Serpenoid based locomotion gaits on modular snake robots'
---

Worked on developing ROS enabled code base to control highly articulated snake robots comprised of identical revolute modules. The code base was developed for both the hardware and Pybullet simulations of the robot.

Implemented and demonstrated various gaits based on compound serpenoid equations for locomotion in unstructured and confined environments, such as slithering, sidewinding, rolling, pole climbing etc.
