excerpt: 'Evolutionary learning for Central Pattern Generator and Radial Basis Function network based legged locomotion'
---

Designed an Evolutionary algorithm to optimize adaptability of model-free CPG-RBFN legged robot controller, overcoming limitations in Probability-Based Black Box Optimization and enhancing robustness to noise.

Demonstrated empirical evaluations on the Half Cheetah environment, validating the neuroevolution policyâ€™s capability to learn walking behaviors amid noise and diverse inputs.
