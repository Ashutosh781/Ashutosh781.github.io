Developed a method to utilize 2D tomographic medical imaging for building and calibrating a simplified FEM simulation of 3D vessel structures.

Used the FEM simulation to estimate the material properties of tissues in calibration by using an optimization for the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. This is achieved by maximizing the IoU area between the deformed vessels observed in real-world ultrasound images captured by a robot and vessel cross-section from the simulated deformed model.
