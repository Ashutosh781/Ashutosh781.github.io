title: "EchoSLAM / Pipebots - Localisation using acoustic echoes"

excerpt: 'Localisation using acoustic echoes in pipe-like environments'
---

Developed a system that uses acoustic pulses to aid in the relative localisation of a team of robots, while detecting obstacles and mapping the environment using acoustic echoes.

Worked on ROS2 package in collaboration with Pipebots team to enable a robot simulation in Gazebo to use acoustic echoes for SLAM.
