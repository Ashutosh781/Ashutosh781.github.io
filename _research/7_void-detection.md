excerpt: 'Semi automated void detection pipeline for rubble pile in Search and Rescue operation'
---

Developed a semi-automated void detection pipeline for recorded point clouds of rubble pile in a Search and Rescue operation, reducing false positives in detected candidate void regions.

Our method uses images of static structures around the rubble to reconstruct and register point clouds from multiple days using Structure from motion pipeline.

Above image shows the void detection setup - 1) The use of UAS images (Seen in a.) for generating a layered 3D reconstruction (Seen in b.) of the collapse scene. 2) Voids annotated by experts (Seen in c.) being identified by our method (Seen in d.)
