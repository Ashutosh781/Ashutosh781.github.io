excerpt: 'Reconfigurable and scalable reinforcement learning based decentralized Multi-Biped Control for payload transport'
---

Developed a decentralized control system for multi-biped robot carriers, enabling payload transport over rough terrain using bipedal robots.

Designed and implemented a reinforcement learning-based controller that adapts to varying numbers and configurations of rigidly attached robots without retraining.

Conducted extensive simulation experiments and demonstrated successful real-world tests with Cassie robots.

Achieved a scalable solution for multi-biped transport systems, marking a first in the field for handling challenging terrains with legged robots.
